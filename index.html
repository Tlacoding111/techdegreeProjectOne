        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Being a front-end developer is more than a career and it is more than a lifestyle.
          It is an opportunity to help people bring their creative ideas to life. There are many 
          individuals who know what they want their websites to look like, but they do not how to create it.</p>
        <p>I want to become competent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I can help others improve 
            their websites. As a result, their passions, their companies, and their lifestyles will grow.</p>
        <p>I have always had a passion in leadership and my motto is to lead people to become better than
            they expect to be. It is truly an incredible feeling that I can continue my passion through coding.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I aspire to work for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence. Before my journey in coding,
            they were many companies I wanted to work at, but could not because I was missing the required skills. Computer programming has
            given me the second chance to work for the companies I have always dreamed about.
